## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

- Query strings are capable of exchanging information between code and a website. If a question mark is added to a url, then whatever follows after it will be the query string being passed.

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

- Query strings are written at the end of a url after a question mark is added, if more than one parameter needs to be included, then they can be strung together with an '&'. This can only happen though, if the query is made equal to its respective value.

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

- Query parameters would be the most useful with arrays of objects, since you can use query strings to parse certain values attached to those objects. Using the square brackets in the string itself will even parse an object as a parameter.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Burger shack was just a simple introduction to nodejs, and practice with the tools needed to build an application on the back-end. The assignment mostly focused on the postman app, most likely because it allows you to build an API.
