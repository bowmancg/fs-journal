## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing are the three best ways to test software in vue and each method offers a unique role in testing. Unit testing allows the testing of individual units in isolation, component testing allows you to see which component is working from the DOM, and end to end allows you to validate all layers of your application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- I personally prefer unit testing since it lets me to methodically test everything I have one component at a time in vue, it may be a bit slower but at least I can be sure that it works before I move on to something else. It is also something I can easily understand as a stepping stone if I want to learn more about the other frameworks this method supports.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- I don't think any of these methods are not useful they all have something to offer, but the one I like the least is component testing. DOM errors for vue may be more descriptive than errors in other languages, but I've only ever found that the DOM only really excels at debugging instead of testing.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- The first decision our team made today was that we were only going to swap out front end and back end roles once per day so we wouldn't have to distract ourselves by switching gears all the time in this project. That said, I was working on the server for most of the day trying to figure out how our api is going to interact with the server or if it should be able to interact with the server at all.
