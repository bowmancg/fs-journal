> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

- Callback hell happens whenever people try to get javascript to execute their code visually from top to bottom. The lines will usually look like a pyramid flipped on its side, and it will try to execute its first line before moving on to the second.

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

- The asynchronous term only means that whatever function it executes will take time to do so. Since async can be used to delay a function, it can be used in a callback to ease the execution time of whatever the callback is trying to do.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

- Make the code shallow in order to give the functions more descriptive function names. Make small modules that each perform a specific task, and always have a plan to handle every single error the code can throw.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Async functions appear to be prominent in writing code with API, which would make sense since async seems to work best with moving around data on a delay. This would be useful when working with a generated API.
