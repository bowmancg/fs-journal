# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- The day started out well enough, I basically got the entire back end finished over the weekend so I will only have to worry about the client for the rest of the week.

- The only way I know how to manage stress is by walking away from the code for a bit and timeboxing when appropriate.

- The many to many relationship with the VaultKeep is something I might not know how to do on my own, so I might need some help with the get and delete functions for its model.
