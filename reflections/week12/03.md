# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is your Vue application shaping up? Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- I have been worried about styling the application ever since I finished the server, so I have been just been trying to work on the functionality first.

- I may be getting a bit worried about completing the requirements, however I am scheduling certain times of the day to spend on a specific task.

- The basic functionality is proving to be a bit more of a hassle than I thought it would, so I am just goong to have to get more help in the lab for it.
