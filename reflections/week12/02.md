# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? Are you working from client -> server or focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- Working on how to render keeps and vaults have been my primary focus today but I am also hoping that I will be able to get started on the forms today along with the modal to support them.

- It is only Tuesday so I can't say I'm that stressed yet, but I can guarantee that I'll have to start managing it in about two days.

- Getting the UI to render everything for mobile while also rendering specific components at once is something that tends to worry me a lot whenever it comes web design.
