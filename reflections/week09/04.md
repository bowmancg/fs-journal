## Questions

1. What is an ***SSL certificate***?

- They are small files that establish encrypted links between a web server and the browser, which keeps all the information passed between the two private. A submission form with personal information would be one example where an SSL certificate would be used, webpage functions like these need to be kept safe from hackers and malicious users.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

- The certificate types required for encryption are called domain, organization, and extended validation. And the certificates required for the domain number are single, multidomain, and wildcard. The single domain type only protects the access of one domain and cannot be used by any others, wildcards can be used for only one domain but also several other subdomains, and multidomain as the name implies is the type that secures multiple domains with the same certificate.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

- The best benefit speaks for itself, keeping hackers and malicious users out of sensitive data whenever someone visits your webpage has to be the number one reason to get an SSL certificate in the first place. Protecting your users privacy should be the top priority for any designer who wants to build a reliable application.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
