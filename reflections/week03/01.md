## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

- It can keep functions from getting too long and cluttering up the application. It also allows you use exported snippets of javascript in other parts of the code.

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

- Export defaults are only used for specific snippets of code in a different file, like an object or a function. Normal exports can be used for entire files if needed.

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

- Modules can allow multiple scripts to be concatenated, giving it better performance.
