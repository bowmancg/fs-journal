## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

- To reduce the reliance a set of data structures have for each other. This reliance can lead to shared mutable states, which will demand debugging for those structures.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

- This paradigm has allowed for a greater surface of hacker exploitation in public API's since most of that data was externally exposed. The convention was not self-documenting either, which sometimes gave users access to properties they were not supposed to use.

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?
