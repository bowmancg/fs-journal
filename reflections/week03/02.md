## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

- To reduce the reliance a set of data structures have for each other. This reliance can lead to shared mutable states, which will demand debugging for those structures.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

- This paradigm has allowed for a greater surface of hacker exploitation in public API's since most of that data was externally exposed. The convention was not self-documenting either, which sometimes gave users access to properties they were not supposed to use.

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

- ES6 classes use the hash prefix to make private variables that create privacy encapsulation. This method is used on projects where a users personal information may be involved, and renders these fields externally invisible.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Since MVC got its impromptu introduction yesterday, the new project seems to serve the same purpose as the last assignment. This subject is relatively alien right now, so this project may be trying to build familiarization.
