> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

- It is used to solve the problem of synchronization in javascript, since some events in the code need to be kept up to date with the amount of data they push. Keeping that data going on a page while a user delivers their input can be challenging.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- The subscribe method, unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method. These methods are capable of adding, removing, and iterating events respectively.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

- It seems that proxies are meant to return a value inside an object, and the observer methods are supposed to give those values somewhere to go in another file. This appears to be the point of the observer pattern.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Fruit salad seems like it was meant to apply timeout functions to an application being built by MVC. But, I think that learning about the saveState is more important, since it is the structure necessary to save any data that has been inputted to the page.
