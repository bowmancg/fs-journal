## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

- My main concern is with the client side code as usual, but with an entire week to complete the final project, I don't think it will be as big of an issue as it was before. Reminding myself to effectively timebox is also something I will need to pay attention to as well, especially if I need to spend any extra time styling the application.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I have been able to render most of the components I need, however I might not be able to get around to styling the application. Making the different functionalities work with each other always takes precedence in my priorities at least, so hopefully I will be able to render and hide the functionalities in UI by the time I'm finished.
