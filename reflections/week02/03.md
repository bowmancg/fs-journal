## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

- You can write in conditional statements that will evaluate to true or false in order to quickly debug without changing the code in the editor. You can also put in console.log if you want the console to return a specific message. And finally, you can also write the functions themselves if you want to test them first before writing them in the editor.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The elements tab is the place to find the HTML and CSS in the dev tools. It can also edit the code without directly changing it in the editor, so using it as a debugging tool is particularly useful. 

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- One way is to make generous use of break points if there are a lot of issues with the code. Break points can pause selected lines of code, and persist until they are deselected in the source tab.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- The assignment was meant to elaborate on string interpolation and using functions to draw on HTML. It also introduced multiple arrays with objects, and went more in-depth on how to draw object properties from them.
